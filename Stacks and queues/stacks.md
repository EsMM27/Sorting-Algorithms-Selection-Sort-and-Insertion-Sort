1 Stacks
A stack is one of the most prominent and simplest Data Structures used in programming.

A stack is a linear list which contains a collection of items of any type.  
All items on the stack must be of the same type.  New items can be inserted into a stack, and items can be removed from the stack.

Adding and deleting are always carried out from the same end of the stack, called the top of the stack.  A stack therefore, works on the LIFO principle - Last in First out.  That is, the last item that went into the stack is the first item to come out of the stack.	

An everyday example of a stack is a stack of plates commonly found in caf√©s and canteens.  When a customer takes a plate from the top, the plate beneath pops to the top position, ready for the next customer.  The stack is replenished by the staff by adding new plates to the top, thereby pushing new ones onto the stack.  It is the plates that are most recently pushed onto the stack that will be used first.

Another example is a stack of newspapers.  The only thing that can be taken off the stack is the most recently added element.  To get the item at the bottom of the stack, each of the elements on top of it must be removed one by one.
